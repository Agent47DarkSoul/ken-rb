= Ken

* http://www.github.com/michael/ken

== DESCRIPTION:

Ken is a Data Layer for Knowledge Representation.

It's being built to access the Metaweb Services supplied by Freebase.com.
Just born, the projectâ€™s goals are the provision of a concise API for querying and writing.
Therefore it wraps the Metaweb Architecture to smart Ruby Objects (that represent the Metaweb Architecture).

You can navigate the Freebase Graph using a rubyish syntax.

You should be able to use this Library as a Data Layer (instead of or in addition to 
ActiveRecord/DataMapper) for your Web Framework of choice (Merb, Rails).


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
